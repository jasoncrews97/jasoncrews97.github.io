        <p1>There is a common saying that goes, "you are what you eat". Every single organism on Earth
            depends on food to sustain themselves in their day-to-day lives. Since food is such an integral
            part of everyone's lives, we obviously consider food safety and quality to be issues of great
            importance. Contaminated food poses a major public health risk, and people tragically die from 
            foodborne illnesses every year. Our website will allow you to discover information about several
            restaurants in the Prince George's County area and how seriously they take their food safety and
            overall cleanliness. We hope that you will be able to use our work to make safe and informed 
            decisions next time you are choosing where to go out to eat. Stay healthy!
